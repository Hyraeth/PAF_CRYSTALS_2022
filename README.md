Dilithium is a digital signature scheme that is strongly secure under chosen message attacks based on the hardness of lattice problems over module lattices. The security notion means that an adversary having access to a signing oracle cannot produce a signature of a message whose signature he hasn't yet seen, nor produce a different signature of a message that he already saw signed. Dilithium is one of the candidate algorithms submitted to the NIST post-quantum cryptography project.

This project is an implementation of the article CRYSTALS-Dilithium: A Lattice-Based Digital Signature Scheme. This is a Quantum Cryptography method to replace RSA.
